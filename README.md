# Axis of Awesome

This project allowed me to research the top ten biggest Pixar movies based on their rotten tomato ratings and compare them to how much money they each made]

## Requirements
To run this project, you need:
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
    - `pip install pandas`
- Matplotlib
    - `pip install matplotlib`

## Features
- **Reads data from `movies.csv`** using Pandas.
- **Sorts movies by income** from highest to lowest.
- **Displays a bar chart** showing income comparisons.
- **Displays a pie chart** showing percentage distribution and actual income values.

## Usage
**To run,** use the following command in the terminal:
- `python data.py`

The program will output:
- A **terminal chart** of the data set
- A **bar graph** of the data set
- After exiting out of the bar graph, the **pie chart** will appear
